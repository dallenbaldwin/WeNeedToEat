# We Need To Eat

My wife and I have a hard time picking where we're going to eat when we're too lazy to make food.

We also have a really hard time deciding what to cook when we're not too lazy to make food.

## App

Go to [Netlify](https://weneedtoeat.netlify.app) to experience the app for yourself.

## To-do

### Home Page

-  [ ] Clicking "Eat in" should filter out Restaurants
-  [ ] Clicking "Eat out" should filter out home cooked meals
-  [ ] The tags input should add pills containing the desired tag between the submit button and the tag input.
-  [ ] Tags should be able to be removed
-  [ ] Clicking "Tell us what to eat already!" should give you a random meal based on your filter and tags

## Bugs

-  [ ] Meals without tags have a leading comma
-  [ ] That leading comma creates an empty tag in the edit modal

<!-- BUG: tagless entries have a leading comma -->
<!-- BUG: That leading comma creates an empty tag in the edit modal -->

## Enhancements

-  [ ] Debounce new tags instead of making the user hit enter/leave the text input area
